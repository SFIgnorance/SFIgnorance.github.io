          Hello there!
          We're a podcast that engages in conversations with professionals in lots of different fields.
           From climate science to the performing arts, medicine to 
           ethical hacking, we're curious to know more about your experiences and expertise. If you'd like to listen
           to casual conversation between people in different disciplines, and maybe learn something along the way 
           (we sure do!), tune in each week for a brand new exchange!
        </p>
        <p>
          Our podcast started off as an informal conversation amongst friends, but quickly evolved into involving 
          people who have a lot more experience than we do to answer some of our questions. We like to start off with
          an informal icebreaker question, like 'How well can you picture something in your mind?' to ease us all into
          the episode, and then we follow that up with an in-depth discussion with that week's professional on their
          area of expertise.
