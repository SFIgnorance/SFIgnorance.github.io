          We're a group of friends trying to learn more about it all through podcasting by engaging in conversations
           with professionals in lots of different fields. From climate science to the performing arts, medicine to 
           ethical hacking, we're curious to know more about your experiences and expertise.

          Our podcast started off as an informal conversation amongst friends, but quickly evolved into involving 
          people who have a lot more experience than we do to answer some of our questions. We like to start off with
          an informal icebreaker question, like 'How well can you picture something in your mind?' to ease us all into
          the episode, and then we follow that up with an in-depth discussion with that week's professional on their
          area of expertise.
